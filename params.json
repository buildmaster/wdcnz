{"name":"WDCNZ","tagline":"Tech Talks For Web Devs","body":"**WDCNZ**\r\n\r\nWe'd like to thank everyone for their amazing support over the past 5 WDCNZ events, from our speakers, our sponsors, our crew and most importantly our attendees. Without all of you we'd never have been able to put this together and had half a decade of delivering some of the best content and talks.\r\n\r\nAlas all things must come to an end so it is with a heavy heart we announce the end of WDCNZ as we know it. We may be back but at the moment all we can say is that there will be no WDCNZ for 2016.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for all your support\r\n\r\nCharlotte and Owen","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
